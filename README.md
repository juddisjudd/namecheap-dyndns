# namecheap-dyndns

This script uses the WebClient class from the .NET Framework to make an HTTP request to the Namecheap Dynamic DNS API and update the IP address of a specified host. It uses the NetworkCredential class to authenticate the request with your Namecheap API user and key.

To use this script, you will need to replace API_USERNAME and API_KEY with your Namecheap API user and key, and example.com and www with the domain name and hostname that you want to update. You can find your Namecheap API user and key by logging in to your Namecheap account and going to the "API Access" page in the "Advanced Features" section.
